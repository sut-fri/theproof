      <h3>Schrodinger<span>&#39</span>s Equation</h3>
    	<p>This is Schrodinger<span>&#39</span>s equation; it was formulated to estimate the probability of an electron<span>&#39</span>s location in an atom at any given moment<span>&#8212</span> the example equation is for a hydrogen atom. Erwin Schrodinger (1887-1961) was an Austrian quantum physicist who discovered that all particles have a wavelength.  Similar to sound waves, the electrons in matter tide with amplitude. The issue is that the exact location of the electrons in the wave is completely unpredictable; in fact, a single electron can be in multiple locations at once. With the fear that the building blocks of the Universe are patternless and chaotic, mathematicians at the time refused to believe that math couldn<span>&#39</span>t solve everything. Schrodinger proved that even numbers lie. (<a href="https://www.wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/2013/07/30/what-did-schrodingers-cat-experiment-prove/">wtamu.edu</a>)</p></div>

      <h3>What is the state of the cat?</h3>
      <p>In Schrodinger<span>&#39</span>s box, there sleeps a cat. In the box, there also rests a device that has a 50% chance of killing the cat in exactly one hour. At the end of the hour, and before I open the box, what is the state of the cat?</p></div>

      <h3>Einstein<span>&#39</span>s Definition of Insanity:</h3>
      <p>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.</p></div>

      <h3>I think I<span>&#39</span>m going insane</h3>
      <p>I used to think that everything in the Universe was quantifiable. Although the mathematical patterns are too complex for humans to understand, I thought a computer would be able to solve the equations. But definitive answers do not exist. There is no discrete off and on, or 0 and 1. The universe is statistically continuous with an infinite range of probability. I wake up every morning and go to sleep every night. If I do the same thing over and over again, why do I lack stability?</p></div>

      <h3>Dead or Alive</h3>
      <p>What is the probability that the cat is alive? What is the probability that the cat is dead? 100% for both, simultaneously. The moment before I open the box, the moment before we see the cat<span>&#39</span>s state, the state of the cat is a blur of all possible outcomes. Suffering from an existential identity crisis, it<span>&#39</span>s rough not knowing if you are dead or alive, off or on, 0 or 1. So I dedicate this paragraph to the cat. I do it all for the cat.</p></div>

      <h3>Matryoshka</h3>
      <p>You built a hive in my heart. Nesting deep beneath my skin. Resting deep within my sin. Give me all of your honey, so that I can make the hive.</p></div>

      <h3>The Hive</h3>
      <p>I never built walls. I chewed wax until it was a house. A house sounds nicer than walls. It reminds me of home. It shelters me from the cold, from the dark, which is ironic because my house always seemed to be darker inside. Outside looking in, the geometric exterior of my house was beautiful, it was numerical, it was perfect. But as I said, I never had the lights on. This prevented people from peering through my windows. I don<span>&#39</span>t like exterior perceptions of my personal life. I hid in my equations hoping to find a solution, but what if my solution isn<span>&#39</span>t definitive, and I<span>&#39</span>m left calculating for eternity? I don<span>&#39</span>t want my hive to be so small anymore, so I<span>&#39</span>ll stumble in the dark in search of a light switch.</p></div>

      <h3>Simplifications</h3>
      <p>I like to make my ideas abstract. It<span>&#39</span>s much easier for me to turn the lights on when I hide my meaning behind simplifications, but people always confuse what I<span>&#39</span>m trying to say. As this equation simplifies, I fear my ideas are only becoming more complex.</p></div>

      <h3>The Sun and The Moon</h3>
      <p>You are the Sun, and I am the Moon. At night, you illuminate me, you highlight the fine scars of space debris that crater my surface. But once a month, when I do not shine, I am still here, in the dark. But so are you, just below the horizon.<br>

      Sometimes I greet you in the early morning, and sometimes I say goodnight to you in the late afternoon. Crepuscular kisses from 93 million miles away. Sometimes, I feel lonely in the sky, in the dark. If I rise for you, will you do the same for me? Or am I just broken like a tickless clock? But a clock isn<span>&#39</span>t broken if it<span>&#39</span>s still right twice a day. Twice a day when I see you.

      <h3>Collision</h3>
      <p>Not long after the mother nebula collapsed in on herself and ripped her entrails across the solar stem (<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/">solarsystem.nasa.gov</a>), Theia and Earth collided, forming the Moon (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_(planet)#:~:text=Theia%20is%20a%20hypothesized%20ancient,gathering%20to%20form%20the%20Moon.">wikipedia.org</a>). The Moon spins around the Earth, but she spins for the Sun.<br>

      Schrodinger<span>&#39</span>s equation is the collision of physics, chemistry, data science, and philosophy. In the new age of quantum computation, the lines between the sciences blur. A blur of all possible outcomes.<br>

      I like to think that I am a part of the City: I feel the energy of the people who move around me, and I find the patterns of flow on the busy sidewalks. I don<span>&#39</span>t often collide with people, but of all people, I<span>&#39</span>m thankful I collided with you.

      <p>When the Sun greets the Moon, the flowers weep with morning dew. As one kisses good morning and the other kisses sleep tight, the largest star rips the sky and fades the night. But do not worry Sun, I am still here, just below the horizon.</p></div>

      <h3>I do it all for the Moon</h3>
      <p>I<span>&#39</span>ve always felt a connection to the Moon and the flirtatious secrets she whispers. Late one night, she opened my window and hummed her history. The Moon that I look up to is the same moon that looked down at the Roman philosopher Pliny; he believed that a full moon caused more morning dew, which led to increased moisture in the brain, and a higher tendency for madness (<a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/why-do-we-still-believe-in-lunacy-during-a-full-moon#">discovermagazine.com</a>). I do it all for the Sun, the Moon, and all the space in between.</p></div>

      <h3>Quantum theory</h3>
      <p><q>God does not play dice.</q> - Albert Einstein<br>

        Einstein was never a fan of quantum theory. The thought that nothing is certain, not even math, is understandably quite philosophically disturbing. The universe is mostly composed of these uncertain in-betweens: the space between stars, the space between galaxies. But in all of this inky void, despite the suffocating magnitude of the in-between, I still found the warmth of my Sun.</p></div>

        As they look down at me,<br>

        He looks at me too,<br>
